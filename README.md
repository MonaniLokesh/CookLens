## **Recipe Recommendation**

A web-based application that detects the ingredients you have and suggests recipes accordingly. Powered by a YOLO model for ingredient detection and integrated with the Groq API for recipe suggestions, this app makes meal planning quick and simple.


## **Features**
- **Ingredient Detection**: Automatically identifies ingredients from uploaded images.
- **Recipe Suggestions**: Provides recipe ideas tailored to the detected ingredients.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Clean and interactive web interface.


## **Installation**

To install Project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: **`git clone https://github.com/MonaniLokesh/recipe_recommendation.git`**
2. Navigate to the project directory: **`cd recipe_recommendation`**
